The first step in fixing a connection issue is always: 

1. **Is the suit plugged in?** 

This happens to us all the time!

Make sure that the connection is good on computer ↔ USB, and suit ↔ Micro USB. 

Try checking Device Manager - Ports for Arduino Micro or USB Serial Port

If the suit is not recognized at all, it may help to install the [Arduino drivers](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 

If these steps fail, try using different ports on the computer, rebooting the computer, or reinstalling the Arduino drivers. Finally, complain to casey@nullspacevr.com or morgan@nullspacevr.com.
