You may notice that the suit appears to disconnect (a flicker if viewing the Suit icon in Unity). This may be caused by sending too much data to the suit at once. 

Additionally, make sure that the Micro USB connection to the suit is secure.

Please report frequent disconnects to casey@nullspacevr.com.
