
Each of these effects is a family made up of different members. Depending on the strength provided it will select the corresponding family member. The reason for this grouping is that the different family members have very little noticeable difference which created too many different choices. This reduced the meaningful decision making for little benefit. Effect families also opens up the ability to decrease the strength of all elements within a pattern or experience by a scalar amount, allowing for more building flexibility.

###The Future

One goal of ours is to make a more meaningful collection of families that are differentiated in more noticeable ways.
