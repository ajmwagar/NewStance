* Are the suit's power and data cables plugged in?
* Does the NullSpace Suit Icon turn green in a NullSpace test scene? 
* Is the NullSpace Service running?
* Did the suit [vibrate all motors on startup?](pad-malfunctioning) 

#### Reset the suit
This is a catch-all solution.
Unplug both cables and then plug in the power cable, followed by the data cable. 

Indication that motors are functional is given by the startup sequence, which will trigger every motor on the suit sequentially. **This sequence kicks in about 10 seconds after a reset.**
